           an id from the sequence we use below in case the selected id is
           -2000. We can't use that because when call .save() on AuthUser, it
           will not refresh the Principal entity after inserting the row in the
           database and therefore Hibernate won't be aware of the new id. When
           it tries to write a row in AuthUser's table with id -2000 it will
           fail with a foreign key violation.
           Ultimately, this should be fixed by changing the GORM mapping and
           maybe even the schema.
